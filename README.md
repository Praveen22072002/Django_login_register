In this project, I have created a Django app named "Dashboard," which includes an app called "App." All the main files are stored in the "Dashboard" directory. I have provided a requirements.txt file containing all the necessary dependencies. You can install these dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`. To start the Django server, use the command `py manage.py runserver`.
